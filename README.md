# CA Monk - Blog Application Assignment

As part of this assignment, I built a blog application using React + TypeScript with TanStack Query for server state management and Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui for styling.

Implemented fetching of all blogs using GET /blogs and displayed them in a scrollable left panel

Implemented fetching of a single blog by ID using GET /blogs/:id and displayed full blog details in the right panel

Managed server state, caching, loading, and error states using TanStack Query

Created a clean two-panel layout where selecting a blog updates the detail view
